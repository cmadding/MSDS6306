## Submission

ALL MATERIAL MUST BE KNITTED INTO A SINGLE, LEGIBLE, AND DOCUMENTED HTML DOCUMENT. Use RMarkdown to create this file. Formatting can be basic, but it should be easily human-readable. Unless otherwise stated, please enable {r, echo=TRUE} so your code is visible. 

## Questions

**Background:** Brewmeisters in Colorado and Texas have teamed up to analyze the relationship between ABV and IBU in each of their states.  Use the data sets from the project to help them in their analysis.  There three main questions of interest are 1) Is there a significant linear relationship between ABV (response) and IBU (explanatory), 2) Is this relationship different between beers in Colorado and Texas and 3) Is there a significant quadratic component in this relationship for either Colorado or Texas or both?

### I. KNN Regression versus Linear Regression
## A. Clean an prepare the data:

    1. Create column for brewery ID that is common to both datasets similar to what you did in the project. So we can merge!

```{r trim white space, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#function to trim white space
trim <- function (x) gsub("^\\s+|\\s+$", "", x)
```

```{r readData, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#read in the two datasets
breweries <- read.csv("Data/Breweries.csv")
#States has a leading space, removing it
breweries$State <- trim(breweries$State)
beers <- read.csv("Data/Beers.csv")
```

    2. Merge the beer and brewery data into a single dataframe.

```{r mergeData, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#rename Brew_ID to Brewery_id to merge data
colnames(breweries)[1] <- "Brewery_id"
#both have a "Name" two for different groups
#rename Name to Brewery_Name
colnames(breweries)[2] <- "Brewery_Name"
#rename Name to Beer_Name
colnames(beers)[1] <- "Beer_Name"
#merge both data sets
brew_beer <- merge.data.frame(beers, breweries, by = "Brewery_id")
```

    3. Clean the State Column … get rid of extraneous white space.
    
**This is handled with the trim fubction above.**

    4. Create One Dataset that has only Colorado and Texas beers and no IBU NAs … name it “beerCOTX”

```{r create beerCOTX, echo=TRUE}
#create beerCOTX with only TX and CO, removing NAs from IBU
beerCOTX <- filter(brew_beer,!is.na(IBU), State == "CO" | State == "TX")
```

    5. Order beerCOTX by IBU (ascending) ... this will be important later in graphing
    
```{r order beerCOTX bt IBU, echo=TRUE}
beerCOTX <- beerCOTX[order(beerCOTX$IBU),]
```

## C. Compare two competing models: External Cross Validation

    8. For this assignment we will concentrate only on the Texas data! Create a training and test set from the data (60%/40% split respectively). Print a summary of each new data frame… there should be two: TrainingTX, TestTX.
    
```{r spliting Texas into Training and Test, echo=TRUE}
#create the beerTX data set
beerTX <- filter(beerCOTX, State == "TX")
# Splitting the beerTX dataset into the Training set and Test set
# install.packages('caTools')
set.seed(7) # Set Seed so that same sample can be reproduced in the future
split = sample.split(beerTX$ABV, SplitRatio = .6)
TrainingTX = subset(beerTX, split == TRUE)
TestTX = subset(beerTX, split == FALSE)
#A summary of the TrainingTX data
summary(TrainingTX)
#A summary of the TestTX data
summary(TestTX)
```

    9. Using the training data, fit a KNN regression model to predict ABV from IBU. You should use the knnreg function in the caret package. Fit two separate models: one with k = 3 and one with k = 5. (This is 2 models total.)
    
```{r fit a KNN k3, echo=TRUE}

#fit a KNN regression model using knn.reg to predict ABV from IBU, k = 3
Train3TX.knn<- FNN::knn.reg(TrainingTX$IBU, y=TrainingTX$ABV, k=3)
plot(TrainingTX$IBU, Train3TX.knn$pred, xlab="IBU", ylab="Predicted ABV", main = "KNN K=3")
#print fit a KNN regression model to predict ABV from IBU, k = 3
Train3TX.knn
```

```{r fit a KNN k5, echo=TRUE}
#fit a KNN regression model to predict ABV from IBU, k = 5
Train5TX.knn<- knn.reg(TrainingTX$IBU, y=TrainingTX$ABV, k=5)
plot(TrainingTX$IBU, Train5TX.knn$pred, xlab="IBU", ylab="Predicted ABV", main = "KNN K=5")
#Print fit a KNN regression model to predict ABV from IBU, k = 5
Train5TX.knn
```

    10. Use the ASE loss function and external cross validation to provide evidence as to which model (k = 3 or k = 5) is more appropriate. Remember your answer should be supported with why you feel a certain model is appropriate. Your analysis should include the average squared error (ASE) for each model from the test set. Your analysis should also include a clear discussion, using the ASEs, as to which model you feel is more appropriate.
    
```{r ASE loss function and external cross validation, echo=TRUE}

# Fit the model on the training set and test out k at 3, 5 and 7
set.seed(123)
TXmodel <- caret::train(
  ABV ~ IBU, data = TrainingTX, method = "knn",
  trControl = trainControl("cv", number = 10),
  preProcess = c("center","scale"),
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(k = c(3, 5, 7, 9)
  ))
# Plot model error RMSE vs different values of k
plot(TXmodel)
# Best tuning parameter k that minimize the RMSE
TXmodel$bestTune
# Make predictions on the test data
predictions <- TXmodel %>% predict(TestTX)
head(predictions)
# Compute the prediction error RMSE
RMSE(predictions, TestTX$ABV)
#Lets add the predictions to the test data
TestTX$ABVPredistions <- predictions
head(TestTX)
TXmodel
```
**I ran the test on a K of 3 and a K of 5. Out of those numbers the 5 scored slightly better. When I trained the TXmodel I wanted to see if there were any better values for K so I added 7 and 9 and plotted the results. Looking at the graph and the bestTune data we can now see that a K of 7 is the best number.
    
ASE=  (∑▒(y ̃_i-y_i )^2 )/n  

Here y ̃_i is the predicted ABV for the ith beer, y_iis the actual ABV of the ith beer and n is the sample size.

    11. Now use the ASE loss function and external cross validation to provide evidence as to which model (the linear regression model from last week or the “best” KNN regression model from this week (from question 10)) is more appropriate.
    
**Looking at the numbers from last week, the best I could do was an RMSE of 0.009727404 with just the IBU data and 0.009718517 with the IBU squared.**
   
    12. Use your “best” KNN regression model to predict the ABV for an IBU of 150, 170 and 190.  What issue do you see with using KNN to extrapolate?
**This is an observation so you should always be careful when you extrapolate.**

```{r TXmodel is here, echo=TRUE}
TXmodel
```

### II. KNN Classification

We would like to be able to use ABV and IBU to classify beers between 2 styles: American IPA and American Pale Ale.
   
    13. Filter the beerCOTX dataframe for only beers that are from Texas and are American IPA and American Pale Ale.
    
```{r create beerTX_AIPA_APA,echo=TRUE}
#create beerTX_AIPA_APA with only TX American IPA and American Pale Ale (APA), removing NAs from IBU
beerTX_AIPA_APA <- filter(beerTX, Style == "American IPA" | Style == "American Pale Ale (APA)")
head(beerTX_AIPA_APA)

#convert to a character
beerTX_AIPA_APA$Style <- factor (as.character(beerTX_AIPA_APA$Style))

#then back to a factor to get rid of the extra styles 
beerTX_AIPA_APA$Style <- factor (beerTX_AIPA_APA$Style)

str(beerTX_AIPA_APA$Style)
```
    
    14. Divide this filtered data set into a training and test set (60/40, training / test split).
    
```{r IPA training and test set, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(7) # Set Seed so that same sample can be reproduced in future also
split = sample.split(beerTX_AIPA_APA$ABV, SplitRatio = .6)
TrainingTXIPA = subset(beerTX_AIPA_APA, split == TRUE)
TestTXIPA = subset(beerTX_AIPA_APA, split == FALSE)
#A summary of the TrainingTX data
summary(TrainingTXIPA)
#A summary of the TestTX data
summary(TestTXIPA)
```

    15. Use the class packages knn function to build an KNN classifier with k = 3 that will use ABV and IBU as features (explanatory variables) to classify Texas beers as American IPA or American Pale Ale using the Training data.  Use your test set to create a confusion table to estimate the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the model.
    
```{r Classification, echo=TRUE}
# Classification using Kmeans clustering and KNN
resultsTXIPA3 = class::knn(TrainingTXIPA[,c(4:5)],TestTXIPA[,c(4:5)],TrainingTXIPA[,6], k = 3)
TestTXIPA$StylePred = resultsTXIPA3
TestTXIPA

#Confusion Matrix on ConMtableTestTXIPA
ConMtableTestTXIPA <- table(TestTXIPA$Style,TestTXIPA$StylePred)
confusionMatrix(ConMtableTestTXIPA)
```
    
   
    16. Using the same process as in the last question, find the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of a KNN model with k = 5.  Which is better?  Why?
    
**The model with k = 5 out performs the other. The ability to have a larger number to group with caused this model to do better.** 
    
```{r accuracy sensitivity and specificity k5, echo=TRUE}
resultsTXIPA5 = class::knn(TrainingTXIPA[,c(4:5)],TestTXIPA[,c(4:5)],TrainingTXIPA[,6], k = 5)
TestTXIPA$StylePred5 = resultsTXIPA5
TestTXIPA

#Confusion Matrix on ConMtableTestTXIPA
ConMtableTestTXIPA5 <- table(TestTXIPA$Style,TestTXIPA$StylePred5)
confusionMatrix(ConMtableTestTXIPA5)
TestTXIPA
```

    BONUS (5 pts total): We did not have a lot data to build and test this classifier.
  
    Check out the class package’s knn.cv function that will perform leave-one-out cross validation.
  
    What is leave-one-out CV (2pts)?
  
  **"Leave-one-out cross validation is K-fold cross validation taken to its logical extreme, with K equal to N, the number of data points in the set." https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/tut5/node42.html**
  
    Get the accuracy metric for from this function for both the k = 3 and k = 5 KNN classifiers (2pts).
    
```{r accuracy metric for k3, echo=TRUE}
resultsTXIPA3knn.cv <- knn.cv(TrainingTXIPA[,c(4:5)], TrainingTXIPA[,6], k = 3, prob = TRUE)
resultsTXIPA3knn.cv
```

```{r accuracy metric for k5, echo=TRUE}
resultsTXIPA5knn.cv <- knn.cv(TrainingTXIPA[,c(4:5)], TrainingTXIPA[,6], k = 5, prob = TRUE)
resultsTXIPA5knn.cv
```
    
    Which model is suggested by the leave-one-out CV method (1pt)?
    
  **The k=5 model.**
